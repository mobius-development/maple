<p>
  Not everyone is perfect, we all make mistakes. If you notice a bug which is not a significant security or privacy risk, feel free to open a pull request. Alternatively, if the bug is major, and potentially could have drastic side effects, contact the lead maintainer of this project immediately, with a detailed explanation on how to replicate the bug, or where the vulnerability is.

  This allows us to ensure development is as swift as possible, and that developers can easily make applications without nitpicking at security details.
